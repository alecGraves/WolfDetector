# üê∫ WolfDetector üê∫ 

## Easily train your computer to detect ANYTHING üîéüñºüöÄ

WolfDetector is a visual object detection library focusing on ease of use and accessibility. It is implemented in the Wolfram Language. The only thing you need to install to get started is [the Wolfram Engine](https://www.wolfram.com/engine/) (currently a 1GB download, cross-platform).

WolfDetector is based on the [YOLOv2 neural network architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242v1), and it uses a [pre-trained model](https://resources.wolframcloud.com/NeuralNetRepository/resources/YOLO-V2-Trained-on-MS-COCO-Data_1) to speed up training time and reduce the number of training examples you need for your dataset. Because of this, training can be done quickly with only a laptop CPU.

Additionally, WolfDetector can take advantage of Nvidia GPU technology to make training even *faster*.

## Getting Started
Object detection the problem of locating objects in an image. WolfDetector is a program which learns to do object detection by learning from data. To train WolfDetector on your data, you first need to build your own dataset - or alternatively find one that someone else has made. 

After you have a dataset, it is simple to use the environment of your choice to complete training and run your WolfDetector.

### Wolfram Desktop
1. Get your dataset

2. Extract key information from that dataset

3. Create a training model for your dataset

4. Convert your dataset to a training dataset

5. Train your model

6. Convert your trained model to a prediction model

7. Use your prediction model üöÄ
